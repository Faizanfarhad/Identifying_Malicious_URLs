# 🛡️ Identifying Malicious URLs

A machine-learning based Python project to detect whether a given URL is malicious or benign. This system processes URLs, uses a trained model, and predicts if the URL could be harmful — helping enhance cybersecurity by identifying phishing, malware, or other unsafe web addresses.

# 📌 Features

* 🔍 URL Classification — Classifies URLs as malicious or benign using a trained model

* 🧠 Machine Learning Model — Pre-trained model included for prediction

* 🪄 Prediction Script — Easy script to input new URLs and get results

* 📁 Modular Code Structure — Organized into source and support files
